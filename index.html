      <p>The game Sudoku was created by a Japanese businessman named <em>Maki Kaji</em>. Kaji was born in Sapporo, Japan on October 8th, 1951. He was widely known as the <em>"Father of Sudoku"</em>, after creating the game in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Although sudoku-type patterns had been used earlier in agricultural design, their first appearance in puzzle form was in 1979 in a New York-based puzzle magazine, which called them Number Place puzzles. They next appeared in 1984 in a magazine in Japan, where they acquired the name sudoku (abbreviated from <em>suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru</em>, meaning <em>“the numbers must remain single”</em>). In spite of the puzzle’s popularity in Japan, the worldwide sudoku explosion had to wait another 20 years.</p>
      <p><strong><em>This site was created in honour of the late Maki Kaji, who passed away on August 10th, 2021.</em></strong></p>
